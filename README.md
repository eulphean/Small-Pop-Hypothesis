# Small-Pop-Hypothesis
In 2018, Amay Kataria engaged with visual artist [Galen Odell-Smedley](https://www.galenodellsmedley.com/) to contribute his programming skills to develop custom software for [Small-Pop Hypothesis](https://www.galenodellsmedley.com/smallpop-hypothesis) - a robotics project that was shown as part of the MFA show at Sullivan Galleries in Chicago. There project consisted of two robotic arms, one moved in the horizontal direction and the other in the vertical direction. The novel software algorithm developed for this project had to coordinate the two arms to slowly ceramic objects off the sculpture.
